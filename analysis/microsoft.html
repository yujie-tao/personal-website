				<p>This is a class project of my Market Intelligence class under School of Media and Journalism. The market industry report aims to provide our client, Microsoft, with a view of a market using existing sources of information to understand competitors, consumers and market potential for new products or services based on previous activities and responses.

				</br></br>The final report includes two main parts: Scenario Planning and Performance Dashboard. Collaborating in group, we analyzed relevant trends to predict different probable scenarios for our client, Microsoft. We developed the base case scenario, sub optimal performance, optimal performance and unicorn scenario. Providing suggestions to each scenarios, we highlight outside of industry examples of when unicorn events have historically occurred.  

				</br></br>Performance dashboard includes our selection of key performance metrics for Microsoft in various departments to track real-time performance of the company. Visualizing in Tableau, we made performance dashboard mockup. For each department, we selected the most representative metrics to consist of executive dashboard. A version of dashboard representing a branch of Microsoft from an international country was also included.
