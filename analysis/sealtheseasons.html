				<p>In fall 2016, I participated in an advertising and marketing case competition called Crash Campaign. During 24 hours, I grouped with four other students, conducted research and developed strategy to solve the marketing issue for a local client, Seal the Seasons, created creative prototypes to implement the strategy and pitched to a panel of experienced judges and clients.</p>

			<p></br>PROJECT: “Bring your Farmer to the Table” Holiday Campaign for Seal the Seasons


			</br></br><u>Overview</u>
			</br>The purpose of this campaign is to introduce shoppers to locally grown, locally frozen food provided by Seal the Seasons. This campaign will center around making the brand connect with close-knit communities by interacting with them through public events and social media. A large component of this campaign is to provide complete transparency of product, which is achieved through storytelling using the hashtag #FarmerToTable.

			</br></br><u>Objective</u>
			</br>Between November 29th and January 31st, we want to increase overall website traffic by 50%. We will create an Instagram account and garner followers using the #FarmerToTable hashtag, releasing Seal the Season’s biweekly newsletter and hosting a ribbon-cutting ceremony for our community garden.

			</br></br><u>Target Audience</u>
			</br>Primary demographics of the brand currently are health conscious women who tend to do the majority of the shopping for their household. This target market consists largely of moms, ages 30-35, and middle-aged women.

			</br></br>The target audience of this campaign have health goals and are involved within their community. They are active on social media and love using Instagram and watching Buzzfeed-like cooking videos. They have a knack for the arts and are concerned with environmental justice. They are often influencers and act as ambassadors for the movement to keep food local. They shop at local establishments or markets, like Weaver Street, weekly.

			</br></br><u>Result Expectations</u></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increased exposure to print media including press releases and newsletters</li>
				<li>Increased community awareness of Seal the Seasons and importance of local produce</li>
				<li>Aligned in minds of consumers with local food movement</li>
				<li>Established social media personality and presence</li>
			</ul>
