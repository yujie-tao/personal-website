## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="./img/me.jpg">

Hi! I am a senior year student of B.S. Computer Science and B.A. Media and Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.


I am currently an undergraduate research assistant at [UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group](http://telepresence.web.unc.edu), advised by Professor [Henry Fuchs](http://henryfuchs.web.unc.edu). I didn't fully start my research journey until my senior year. Before diving into academic research, I had experience working in both product management and advertising.

## Research Interest

My research interest is in Human-Computer Interaction, specifically in ubiquitous computing. I am passionate about new modalities of interaction between human and machines, as well as emerging interfaces.

<!-- ### Research projects -->

The research project I am currently involved in is **high-precision gaze tracking**, in which I collaborate with [Conny Lu](https://criminalking.github.io/about/), [Praneeth Chakravarthula](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~cpk/) and [Nolan Scobie](https://nolanscobie.com/). The ability to push eye-tracking accuracy forward aligns with my research interest in building the next generation of interaction between human and computing systems.


## Personal Projects
In my spare time, I work on fun projects to try out new things.

[Touchless UI](https://github.com/yujie-tao/touchless-ui) (September 2019)

I always aspire to explore interaction beyond keyboards and touch. The advances in Computer Vision allow the interaction system to be recognization based. Building upon a hand tracking model, I designed and implemented interactions to control a youtube video with hand gestures.

## Prior to Resaerch

All past experience contribute to who I am today. Both product management and advertising have cultivated me a strong awareness of design, people and computing.
