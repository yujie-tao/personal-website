                <p>As one of the biggest music streaming platforms, Spotify is available in 78 countries and regions throughout the world. In this article, I analyze Spotify from a product perspective, including user problem, user profile, features, competitors and my insights of it moving forward.</p>

                </br></br>
				<h3>User Problem</h3>
				<p>
				“Products and technologies eventually become outdated, but basic market needs may last forever.”

				</br></br>
				Music is a fundamental channel of communication: it provides a means by which people can share emotions, intentions, and meanings even though spoken languages may be mutually incomprehensible (Hargreaves, Dorothy & Raymond, 2002).

				</br></br>
				However, the ways how people hear, listen to, engage with, value, and use music have changed dramatically during the past two centuries. In the nineteenth century, live music could be heard only in private homes or a public concert hall. The development of the mass media in the twentieth century meant that music became much more widely and readily available. The pace of technological change has accelerated further in making music listening as an everyday activity (North, 2004).

				</p>
				<p>
					No matter how differently people consume music nowadays, the primary need. By reading across literature in music psychology, I concluded three major reasons why people need music:
				</p>

				<p><strong>1. Mood management</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Music is used to strategically create and enhance a particular mood or emotion. (e.g., “I listen to music to motivate myself while working”)</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>2. Self-identity</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Music is used for identity development or to portray a social image to others. (e.g., “Music defines who I am.”)</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>3. Interpersonal relationship</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Music is used to promote and maintain social interaction. (e.g., “I listen to have fun with my friends”)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Considering current music streaming platforms, there are several values other products fail to deliver to users but Spotify makes to do so.
				<ul>
					<li>Social connectedness</li>
					<li>Easy picks on the right music</li>
					<li>Unified experience</li>
				</ul>

				</br></br>
				<h3>User Profile</h3>
				<p>Spotify has two-sided users: subscribers and artists, functioning as curators and creators.</p>

				<p></p>
				<h4>Subscribers</h4>
				<p>For subscribers, Spotify adopts a freemium model. The free version allows users to play any song in their catalog on demand with advertisements. Spotify premium is priced at $9.99 per month. Student and family premium plans are $4.99 and $14.99 respectively. Spotify generates the majority of its revenues via subscriptions — premium subscription fee accounts for 89.5% of its quarterly revenue.

				</br></br>
				Based on Spotify press release as of 2018 Q3, the total monthly active users (MAUs) are 191 million. There are 87 million premium subscribers and 109 million ad-supported MAUs. Segmenting MAUs by region, the top three regions are Europe (36%), North America (31%) and Latin America (22%).

				</br></br>
				Specifically profiling Spotify users in the United States, as of March 2018, 55% of U.S. users are aged 18–34 and people aged 45–54 only accounts for 11% of U.S. users, lowest compared to all other age groups. One interesting data point is 19% respondents are reported 55 or older. By gender, 55% Spotify users self-identified as male. By frequency, both weekly usage and monthly usage U.S. users are in increasing trend from 2013 to 2018, with 20% reported monthly usage and 16% reported weekly usage.

				One interesting datapoint is 19% respondents are reported 55 or older. By gender, 55% Spotify users self-identified as male. By frequency, both weekly usage and monthly usage U.S. users are in increasing trend from 2013 to 2018, with 20% reported monthly usage and 16% reported weekly usage.</p>

				<p></p>
				<h4>Artists</h4>
				<p>In November 2015, Spotify introduced a “Fan Insights” panel in limited beta form, letting artists and managers access data on monthly listeners, geographical data, demographic information, music preferences and more. The panel was upgraded to leave beta status, renamed as “Spotify for Artists”, and opening up to all artists and managers in April 2017. In October 2018, Spotify launched features in direct upload, playlist submission and continued to invest in podcast with the aim of making our two-sided marketplace more robust. Approximately 250,000 creators and their teams use Spotify for Artists on a monthly basis.</p>

				</br></br>
				<h3>Features</h3>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Personalized playlists</h4>
				<p>Most music streaming platforms today turn from charts to playlists. Distinguishing the music streaming service from its competition, Spotify provides three types of playlists: algorithmically generated personalized playlist, in-house playlist, and user-generated playlist.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<p><strong>1. Algorithmically generated playlists</strong>
					</br></br>
					Spotify provides exceptional personalization experience by leveraging user data to surface content. Those playlists include “The Daily Mix”, “Discover Weekly” and “Release Radar”.

					</br></br>
					The Daily Mix is a set of up to six pre-mixed playlists inspired by our users’ favorite music. It is designed to provide familiar, comfortable music within each of the user’s top listening modes. There are up-to six Daily Mix playlists served each day, each one is based on a different listening mode.

					</br></br>
					Discover Weekly creates a personalized 30-song playlist for each user every Monday based on users listening habits and other playlists. It’s more adventurous than The Daily Mix for users to explore new music.

					</br></br>

					<strong>2. In-house playlists</strong>
					</br></br>
					Spotify also curates content in-house with playlists like RapCaviar and Fresh Finds. These playlists account for 15% of total listening and present a unique monetization opportunity for sponsored placement for songs and artists.

					</br></br>
					How playlists are attributed under in-house playlist is “just smart”. By categorizing music in “mood”, music is no longer consumed by specific authors or genres. It is consumed by scenarios, such as “Sleep”, “Road Trip”, “Instrumental Study”. As research shows, one primary reason people listen to music is mood management, in which we use music to set different psychological states under different scenarios. A lot of times users don’t know what to listen, but they know what kind of mood they want to achieve or which scenarios are they within. By having playlist organized around scenarios and psychological states, it makes the search experience much more natural for subscribers.

					</br></br>
					<strong>3. User-generated playlists</strong>
					</br></br>
					Spotify’s user-generated playlists may be its biggest competitive advantage. Playlists created and shared by users accounted for 36% of listening hours. Personal playlists are not only created by the user of favorite tracks but also come from popular third parties that share playlists publicly.

					</br></br>
					User-generated playlists also provide artists with more opportunities to get exposed to more subscribers and promote their songs.
					</p>
				</ul>
				</p>

				<p></p>
				<h4>Unified app experience</h4>
				<p>Spotify offers a unified experience by allowing users to sync streaming music across different devices. “Spotify Connect”, was announced in September 2013 as a way to give users “effortless control of your music across your phone, tablet and now speakers with millions of songs built right in.”

				</br></br>
				Just like Apple AirPlay, Spotify seeks out compatible devices that use the same Wi-Fi network and hooks up to them wirelessly to stream music. Spotify also features a web player, for those who are unable to — or do not want to — download an app.

				</br></br>
				As of user interface, Spotify’s design is clean and sleek. Spotify attracts young people most and its color theme perfectly positions listening to music as a cool thing to do. Its ease of use also corresponds to the value held by today’s young users.</p>

				<p></p>
				<h4>Social features</h4>
				<p>One iconic feature of Spotify is integrating social aspect with music streaming experience, in a subtle but powerful way. Music is all about sharing and communication. Technology advancement, to some extent, confines music into one’s headphones. The social feature in music streaming app not only satisfy the social interaction side music consumption but also help the product to build up user loyalty.
				
				</br></br>
				“Friend Activity” on Spotify shows the listening activity of any friends or public profiles (including brands and celebrities) that a user follows. Through this feature, a user can build up his own musical identity and explore new songs listened by their friends as well. For those who prefer enjoying music in private, “private session” is also provided.</p>
				
				</br></br>
				<h3>Competitors</h3>

				<p>Within the current music streaming market, Spotify has three major competitors.</p>
				
				<p></p>
				<h4>Pandora</h4>
				<p>Founded in 2000, Pandora is a music streaming and automated music recommendation internet radio service based in Oakland, California. With 71.4 million active users and 6 million subscribers, Pandora makes most of its money from the ads on its freemium tier. On September 24, 2018, Sirius XM Holdings announced its intent to acquire Pandora for $3.5 billion.</p>

				<ul>
					<p><strong>Strength</strong>
					</br></br>
					1. Public preference 
					</br></br>
					While Spotify attracts young people aged 18 to 29, Pandora has a much higher public favorite in the population aged over 30. The research conducted by Morning Consult shows that over half of the respondents aged 30+ voted for Pandora over Spotify or Apple Music. Pandora has the highest preference in the population aged 55 to 64.
					</br></br>

					2. Three-tier subscription plan
					</br></br>
					Different from Spotify that provides only free-tier and premium plan, Pandora rolls out mid-level subscription plan called Pandora Plus for users only want ad-free streaming experience but not download/playlist creation, etc.
					</br></br>
					<strong>Weakness</strong>
					</br></br>
					1. Only serves the users in the United States
					To comply with the requirements and protections offered by the DMCA, Pandora uses IP addresses to block users from non-complying countries, which constrains its global user development opportunity as compared to other music streaming platforms.
					</p>
				</ul>
				</br></br>

				<h4>Apple Music</h4>
				<p>Apple Music, the tech giant Apple’s music streaming service, was announced on June 8, 2015, and launched on June 30, in over 100 countries worldwide. Initieally strictly a music service, Apple Music began expanding into video in 2017. By July 2018, Apple Music had surpassed Spotify in terms of paying users in the United States. As of December 2018, there were more than 56 million subscribers and the number is still growing.</p>
				<ul>
					<p><strong>Strength</strong>

					</br></br>
					1. Integration with Apple ecosystem
					</br></br>
					As a built-in app for all Apple hardware, Apple Music is born with advantages as an installed app among Apple users. Integrating with iTunes library, Apple Music provides users with the option to freely browse their own music alongside Apple’s standard catalog. Any music they have — whether previously purchased via the iTunes Store, ripped from a physical CD, or uploaded to iTunes Match — will appear in user’s Apple Music library.
					</br></br>	
					2. Offline Downloads
					</br></br>
					Apple Music allows users to download music across ten different devices, with no real limit on how much one can download.

					</br></br>
					<strong>Weakness</strong>
					</br></br>
					1. Cluttered user interface
					</br></br>
					Apple Music was criticized for its “unintuitive” interface when it was first launched. With the major redesign in iOS10, it started to receive more positive reviews but still not as elegant or intuitive as Apple promised.
					</br></br>
					2. No free-tier plan, only paid plan 
					</br></br>
					Unlike other music streaming platform, Apple Music doesn’t provide a free-tier plan. The only available monthly option is 9.99 per month with the first 3-month free trial. This raises the entry bar for people to choose
					Apple Music.
					</br></br>
					3. Device availability
					</br></br>
					Born as Apple products, Apple Music is not widely available across different device as Spotify is. Apple Music does push on extending itself to more platforms. On November 30, 2018, it was announced that Apple Music would be available on Amazon Echo speakers, after previously only being accessible on Apple’s own HomePod speakers.
					</p>
				</ul>
				</br></br>
				<h4>Youtube Music</h4>
				<p>Youtube started its music streaming service in 2015. Youtube Music was renovated in May 2018 to include a web-based desktop player and a redesigned mobile app.</p>
				<ul>
					<p>
					<strong>Strength</strong>
					</br></br>
					1. A billion-plus users base of Youtube
					</br></br>
					In May 2018, YouTube announced the rebranding of Youtube Red to YouTube Premium to include the Youtube Music into the subscription plan bundle and raised the price from $9.99/month to $11.99/month. With over 1.8 billion users every month, Youtube’s existing user base provides Youtube Music insignificant user growth potential.
					</br></br>
					2. Music video experience
					</br></br>
					Integrating with video streaming service, Youtube music provides the best music video experience for its music collection.
					</br></br>
					<strong>Weakness</strong>
					</br></br>
					1. Extra charge for background playing
					</br></br>
					For users who are not on Youtube Premium, it takes user extra charge for background playing, which frustrates Youtube fans.
					</br></br>
					2. Relatively new business under Google
					</br></br>
					Relaunched in May 2018, Youtube Music only provides very basic features as of a music streaming platform. The whole user experience and recommendation system still need time to be built up.
					</p>
				</ul>

				</br></br>
				<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
				<p>From product level, there are several touchpoint Spotify can improve itself. In user experience. Spotify always feels cluttered with playlists everywhere. With the redesign in October, the mobile navigation experience turned out to be much better while the desktop version still remains messy. As of target users, people aged 55+ could be an emerging market for Spotify to explore. From the user research, 19% of Spotify users aged 55+ but it has the lowest customer preference in this group of users.</p>
