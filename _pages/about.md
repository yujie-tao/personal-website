<!-- ## Bio -->
I just graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in Computer Science and Journalism. Coming from a cross-disciplinary background, I enjoy exploring how technology can empower people unobtrusively. My interests lie in wearables and proactive interface.


## Research
This fall, I will join [Prof. Pedro Lope](http://plopes.org)'s Human Computer Integration lab at University of Chicago. Currently, I am working with Dr. Nataliya Kos'myna from MIT Media Lab. During my undergraduate study, I was a research assistant at UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group, advised by Prof. [Henry Fuchs](http://henryfuchs.web.unc.edu).

## Product & Marketing
Beyond research, I have been working in several other verticals through internships and extracurriculars. They lead me to understand how a research idea can evolve into something that people use every day.
