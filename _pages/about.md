<h3>Hi, I am Yujie.</h3>
<p class="about_text"> I recently graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in Computer Science and Journalism. Coming from a cross-disciplinary background, I enjoy exploring how technology can empower people unobtrusively. My interests lie in wearables, haptics and personal sensing.</p>


<p>Currently, I am a research assistant in <a href="http://plopes.org">Human Computer Integration Lab</a> at University of Chicago, advised by Prof. Pedro Lopes. I was also fortunate to work with Prof. Henry Fuchs from UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group and Dr. Nataliya Kos'myna from MIT Media Lab.</p>

<p>Before jumping into HCI research, I had experience in product management and marketing, where I explored areas such as social networks, security and health advertising.</p>
