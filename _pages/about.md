<!-- ## Bio -->

I am a senior year student of B.S. Computer Science and B.A. Media and Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Currently an undergraduate research assistant at [UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group](http://telepresence.web.unc.edu), I am advised by Prof. [Henry Fuchs](http://henryfuchs.web.unc.edu). 


## Research Interest

I am passionate about Human-Computer Interaction, specifically in ubiquitous computing. The new modalities of interaction between humans and machines, as well as emerging interfaces, are where I believe in bringing technology closer to the general public.

My current research project is **gaze tracking for near-eye display**, in which I collaborate with [Conny Lu](https://criminalking.github.io/about/), [Praneeth Chakravarthula](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~cpk/) and [Nolan Scobie](https://nolanscobie.com).
