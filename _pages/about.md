<!-- ## Bio -->

I am a senior year student of B.S. Computer Science and B.A. Media and Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Currently an undergraduate research assistant at [UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group](http://telepresence.web.unc.edu), I am advised by Prof. [Henry Fuchs](http://henryfuchs.web.unc.edu). 


## Research Interest

I am passionate about Human-Computer Interaction. The new modalities of interaction between humans and machines, as well as capability for cognitive enhancement, are where I believe the future interactive technology will head to.

My current research project is on **gaze tracking for near-eye display**, in which I collaborate with [Xinran Lu](https://criminalking.github.io/about/), [Praneeth Chakravarthula](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~cpk/) and [Nolan Scobie](https://nolanscobie.com).
