<div class="col-lg-8 col-sm-12 about">
<p>I recently graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in Computer Science and Journalism. Coming from a cross-disciplinary background, I enjoy exploring how technology can empower people unobtrusively. My interests lie in wearables, haptics and personal sensing.</p>


<!-- ## Research -->
<p>Currently, I am a research assistant in Human Computer Integration Lab at UChicago, advised by <a href="http://plopes.org">Prof. Pedro Lopes</a>. I was also fortunate to work with Prof. Henry Fuchs from UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group and Dr. Nataliya Kos'myna from MIT Media Lab.</p>

<p>Before jumping into HCI research in my senior year, I worked in product management and marketing.</p>
