<!-- ## Bio -->
I recently graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in Computer Science and Journalism. Coming from a cross-disciplinary background, I enjoy exploring how technology can empower people unobtrusively. My interests lie in wearables and personal sensing. 


<!-- ## Research -->
Currently, I am a research assistant in [Prof. Pedro Lopes](http://plopes.org)'s Human Computer Integration Lab at UChicago. I was also fortunate to be advised by Prof. Henry Fuchs from UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group and Dr. Nataliya Kos'myna from MIT Media Lab.

<!--  I also worked with Dr. Nataliya Kos'myna from MIT Media Lab. During my undergraduate study, I was a research assistant at UNC Graphics and Virtual Reality Group, advised by Prof. [Henry Fuchs](http://henryfuchs.web.unc.edu).  -->

Before jumping into HCI research in my senior year, I worked in product management and marketing.

<!-- ## Product & Marketing
Beyond research, I have been working in several other verticals through internships and extracurriculars. They lead me to understand how a research idea can evolve into something that people use every day.
