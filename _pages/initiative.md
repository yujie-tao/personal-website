<!-- ### Underrepresented group in tech -->

Here are some of the initiatives I have engaged in. They are not possible without the awesome people and mentors I have worked with along the way. 

### Diversity in Tech

I was the VP of Marketing at [Pearl Hacks](https://pearlhacks.com), a hackathon for female and non-binary students to explore technology. During a weekend, we provide workshops for beginners to learn about different CS topics and create a platform for them to launch their first projects. In Pearl Hacks 2020, we supported 350+ hackers with 19 workshops, 128 volunteers, 107 mentors, and 38 sponsor companies. Our participants delivered over 70 projects to solve real-world problems.

My effort towards diversity in the tech industry didn't stop at Pearl Hacks. I am currently working with my advisor Prof. Pedro Lopes and other lab members in planning a series of events to introduce under-represented students about electronics. 


### HCI Research Community
I got involved in HCI research in my senior year. Since then, I have been trying to contribute the community. I recently helped organize [CHI 2020 Smell, Taste, & Temperature Symposium](http://stt20.plopes.org) as a moderator. 


### Product Community for Undergraduates

I launched [UNC Product Management Club](https://uncpmclub.com/) in Spring 2019, intending to build a UNC product community. As a two-time product intern at Microsoft, I understand how much lack of resources and understanding for undergraduate students to break into this field. PM Club hosts weekly events, including hands-on workshops and invited talks, to introduce product management to a broader audience. Through partnering with local startups, our members research, propose, and ship product features.
