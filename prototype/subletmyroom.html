		<p>SubletMyRoom is a pre-startup project trying to address the problem of student subleasing. We identify and match students subleasing their apartments/houses with students looking for housing.
		</br>
		</br>

		This is a semester-long project of a Software Startup class under UNC Computer Science department. Through market research and interviews, we identified housing sublease as a pertinent problem of college students, as there is disconnection between two sides of students. To address the problem, our solution is to create a reliable channel for students to connect with each other during the subleasing process.

		</br>
		</br>

		We tested our idea by conducting interviews, prototyping, launching landing page and distributing marketing flyers on around campus. On landing page, we have two sign up forms that collect sublease information. From Mar.20 to Apr. 20, we achieved almost 700 page views on our landing page, with 80 responses for sign-up forms.

		</br>
		</br>
		By using the sublease information collected from sign up form, we manually match student renters with student subleasers.

		</br>
		</br>

		Going forward, we reflected that we need to addressing the legal implications of serving as a third party leasing company, automating the matching process by building a functional website similar to AirBnB and figure out ways to create profit. 


		</br>
		</br>
		During the whole semester, I:

		<ul>
			<li>Conducted market research and interviews to understand user needs</li>
			<li>Determined product functionalities, prototyped in Axure RP and iterated the demo</li>
			<li>Developed prototype in HTML/CSS, Javascript, Express.js and MongoDB</li>
			</ul>
