## Purpose

iBallot is a non-profit pre-startup that informs young voters in North Carolina about state and local elections. Young voters in North Carolina say that they face challenges when attempting to vote for the first time. This can lead to them not showing up to the polls at all. The median age of voting is 57 years old, with residents older than 65 years being fifteen times more likely to cast a ballot than residents ages 18-34.
 

## Team
I worked on this pre-startup idea at [Reese News Lab](http://reesenewslab.org) in UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media in Spring 2018. My collaborators were Raphaëlle Aubert​, Emily Wakeman, Rachel Bridges and Raven Norton.

 During three months, we conducted market analysis, user study, product prototyping, and financial projection. We also presented our work to the dean and alumni of Hussman school.

 I was in charge of user study and product prototyping in this project.

## Target Customers

Our main target customers were young voters who are either currently enrolled in higher education or have recently graduated. According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center, in the 2016 election young voters made up 27 percent of the electorate- only second to the baby boomers, who made up 31 percent. By the 2020 election, young voters are expected to make up the largest part of the electorate. This is one of the reasons that we decided to focus on young voters- they are a huge part of the voting population, and their impact is increasing.

## Product Prototype

The iBallot app provides for main categories of information: who the candidates are, when and where you can vote, a voting FAQ and local policy updates. Each of these four sections provide comprehensive information specific to local and state elections in North Carolina.
