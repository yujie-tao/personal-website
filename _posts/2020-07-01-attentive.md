I was a summer research intern at Fluid Interfaces Group in MIT Media Lab, advised by Dr. Nataliya Kosâ€™myna. I worked on the second-iteration of AttentivU device, an EEG wearable for cognitive enhancement. Focusing on signal processing and machine learning, I developed algorithm to detect change of mental states. 

A potential application for this device is to help patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, to call on caregivers when switch their mental focus.
